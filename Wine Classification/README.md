# Wine Classification:
This project used machine learning skills to study the wine dataset downloaded from UCI's machine learning repository. The dataset was  explored using data visualization, then classified using a logistic regression, which predicts the probalistic effect of the coefficients on classifying the wine as good or bad. The results showed factors that have a low impact on predicting the quality of red wines are citric acid, residual sugars, and density. 


# Motivation
The motivation of this project was to apply machine learning techniques and go through a data project workflow. 

# Skills Demonstrated
- Generate a Logit Regression with a 74% accuracy
- Transform independent variables for modeling purposes
- Transform dependent variables for modeling purposes
- Perform all steps for a Data Science Project 
  - Gather data, clean and explore, visualize and model, present findings

# Build Status
Complete

# Software
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python, using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn
