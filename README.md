# Shanghai Smog
For this project, I downloaded, cleaned, and visualized roughly 6 years of Shanghai Smog data that is available for download on the US Department of State website. This project focuses on statistical analysis and visualization, and data cleaning with Python. This was a project to question a claim and also build a foundation for further research to tell a story. As a person who left Shanghai due to the pollution, this is also grounds for a future blog post that I aim to write in the near future. This project demonstrates my education on statistics and ability to draw accurate and supported claims. In addition, it was practice to use multiple programs to streamline my workflow. Data cleaning and editing were done using python and pandas, which was exported to tableau for faster visualization and exploration, and finally aggregated in a document as a final product.
